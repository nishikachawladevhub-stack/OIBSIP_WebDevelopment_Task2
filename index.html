          <h2>Why I Admire Dr. Kalam</h2>
          <p>
            I admire Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam because he showed how a person with simple beginnings
            can reach great heights through hard work, honesty, and a strong sense of purpose.
            Growing up in a small town, he faced many difficulties, but he never stopped learning,
            never stopped dreaming, and never stopped believing in himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even after becoming a famous scientist and the President of India, he remained humble
            and kind. He spoke gently, encouraged everyone to do their best, and always reminded
            young people that their dreams are powerful. His life proves that true success is not
            just about what we achieve, but about how we inspire others along the way.

          <h2>Qualities That Inspire Me</h2>
          <p>
            There are some special qualities in Dr. Kalam that I want to bring into my own life:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Work:</strong> He worked with full focus and never gave up, even when his projects failed at first.</li>
            <li><strong>Humility:</strong> He treated everyone with respect, from students to world leaders, and never showed pride.</li>
            <li><strong>Love for Learning:</strong> He was always reading, thinking, and exploring new ideas, no matter how old he was.</li>
            <li><strong>Faith in Youth:</strong> He believed that young people could change the future of the country.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Whenever I feel lazy or scared to start something new, I remember how Dr. Kalam
            kept moving forward with patience and a positive mind. It makes me want to try again,
            even if I failed before.
